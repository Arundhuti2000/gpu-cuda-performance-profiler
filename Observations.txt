In the performance under task manager my 4060 is using 100% gpu under 3D continuously, while 3060 is utilising under copy that too not that much only a single spike why


Based on the provided code and GPU specifications from the documents, the different utilization patterns you're seeing between the RTX 4060 and RTX 3060:

The difference in utilization comes down to architectural differences between Ada Lovelace (4060) and Ampere (3060), particularly in how they handle L1 cache and memory operations:

RTX 4060 (Ada Lovelace):
Larger L2 cache (24MB vs 3MB on 3060)
More advanced memory controller
Shows up as "3D" because it's processing the computation mostly on-chip
High utilization because it's keeping the compute units busy
RTX 3060 (Ampere):
Smaller L2 cache (3MB)
Shows spikes in "Copy" because it needs to access main memory more frequently
Lower sustained utilization due to memory bottlenecks




-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Instruction Execution Patterns:
RTX 3060: Shows lower stall percentages (~0.83% per instruction)
RTX 4060: Higher stall percentages (~2.94% per instruction)
This indicates the 4060 spends more time waiting, likely due to its different cache architecture.

Cache Impact:

3060's smaller cache but wider memory bus shows better instruction throughput
4060's larger cache (24MB vs 3MB) appears to introduce more latency in instruction fetching


Instruction Scheduling:

3060 shows more efficient instruction scheduling with Ampere architecture
4060's Ada architecture prioritizes throughput over latency

This suggests:

Different cache hierarchy impacts on instruction fetching
Trade-off between the 4060's higher theoretical performance vs actual instruction execution efficiency
Memory subsystem architectural differences significantly affect instruction-level parallelism

This SASS analysis helps explain why the 3060 shows more consistent performance despite lower peak capabilities, while the 4060 shows higher peak performance but with more variable execution patterns.


Cache Architecture Trade-offs:
The 4060's much larger L2 cache (24MB vs 3MB) creates a "cache-first" approach
While beneficial for repeated memory access, this introduces extra latency for initial cache population
Other testers have noted this behavior particularly in memory-intensive workloads where the data doesn't fit well in cache patterns
